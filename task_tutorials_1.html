The interface on the left displays a visual representation of a porch and three rooms in a house: the bedroom, kitchen, and playroom. This is where the robot will be navigating and performing its tasks.<br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.",
        "The right half of the interface is where you can program the robot. <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.",
        "The robot is designed to act based on a set of rules you provide in the programming interface. Rules consist of TRIGGERS, ACTIONS, and may optionally include STATES. <br><br> For each of the rules you create, you need to specify a <b>TRIGGER, an event that, once it occurs, allows the robot to respond (for example, arriving to the kitchen or its hands becoming full by picking up a toy).<br><br>Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.",
        "In addition to triggers, the robot requires you to specify ACTIONS it needs to perform following the activation of triggers (for example, pick up a toy, move to the kitchen). <br><br>Optionally, you may specify STATES or conditions that a robot may need to evaluate before executing an action within a rule. For example, to know whether or not to pick up a toy (action), the robot needs to know whether it is already holding a toy (state). <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.",
        "Once all the rules are provided to it, the robot executes actions based on these rules towards accomplishing a task. <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.",
        '<div>Now, you will construct a program to make the robot take a toy from the kitchen to the bedroom. At the start the robot might be in one of the four rooms, therefore you need to specify a rule for the robot to go to the kitchen as soon as the program starts. To achieve this, click on the "Controls" tab and drag the piece labeled "if then" and attach it to the "Rules" block found in the programming interface. This block will create the “IF statement and a THEN statement” structure of the first rule. <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',
        'Next, click on the "Events" tab and drag the piece labeled "program started" and attach it to the if in the "if then" piece in "Rules". The “program started” piece is a trigger that activates only once when the program you constructed starts. <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',
        'Next, from the "Actions" tab, drag the "Go to kitchen" piece and attach it to the "if program started" piece. <br><br> The rule you just created instructs the robot to move to the kitchen when the program starts.  <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',
        'Once the robot arrives in the kitchen, it needs to pick up the toy. Before trying to pick up the toy, you will program the robot to check if there is a toy. While this check may seem unnecessary, since we know that the toy will be in the kitchen, in other cases, the robot may not know where the toy is ahead of time, which makes performing this check to see if the toy is in the room helpful. To accomplish this, you need the “<b>if and then</b>” rule. Click on the "Controls" tab and drag the "if and then" piece and attach it to the "Rules" block below the previous rule.<br> <br>Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',
        'You will need to have the robot detect the arriving to the kitchen event before it tries to pick up the toy. Now drag the "I arrived at the kitchen" piece from the "Events" tab and attach it next to if. Then, click on the "States" tab and drag "there is a toy in the room" and attach it next to and. This block would help the robot check if there is a toy in the kitchen as soon as it arrives in the room.  Once the robot arrives at the kitchen and there is a toy in the room, the robot will now need to pick up the toy. For that, drag the "pick up the toy" piece from actions and attach it next to <b>then</b>.<br> <br>Click <b>Next</b> to proceed. ',
        'Now that you have enabled the robot to pick up the toy at the kitchen, you’ll need to program the robot to go to the kitchen after having picked up the toy. To do this, we’ll rely on the event “I picked up an item” to instruct the robot to then head to the playroom. To do this, click on the "Controls" tab and drag the "if then" piece and attach it to the "Rules" below the last two blocks. Then, from the "Events" tab drag "I picked up an item" and attach it to the new "if then" piece. This piece helps the robot detect if it just picked up something.<br> <br>Click <b>Next</b> to proceed. ',
        'Click on the "Actions" tab and drag the "go to the kitchen" piece inside the newly added "if then" block. Change the room from kitchen to <b>playroom</b> by clicking on the caret (downward pointing triangle) of the piece you just attached. This will allow the robot to move to the playroom once it has picked up the toy. <br> <br>Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',
        'Next you will need to program the robot to put down the toy as soon as it gets to the playroom. To do that, drag the "if and then" block and attach it below the last block.

        'Now let\'s work on the final task. In this task, both coffee and mail will start on the porch, and your objective is to program a robot to move the coffee and mail from the porch to the kitchen. However, because the coffee is likely to get cold if outside too long, the robot should first move the coffee to the kitchen and then come back to move the mail to the kitchen. The robot should take the coffee to the kitchen and then the mail to the bedroom in this order. <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',

        'Next, from the "Actions" tab, drag the "Go to kitchen" piece and attach it to the piece "If program started." Change the room from kitchen to porch by clicking on the caret (downward pointing triangle) of the piece you just attached. This will ensure that the robot will go to the porch once the program begins. <br><br>Note that the "go to porch" piece is the same as the "go to kitchen" piece (click on the caret to change the room name). <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',
        'Next, you need to program the robot to pick up the coffee once it gets to the playroom. <br>For this second rule, you will need to have the robot detect the arriving to the porch event before it tries to pick up the coffee. To ensure that the robot executes each action appropriately, it is necessary to incorporate rules like these for every desired action. This is because the robot is designed to carry out actions only when it detects events being triggered. Click on the "Controls" tab and drag the "<b>if and then</b>" piece and attach it to the "Rules" below the "If program started" block.<br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',
        'Now drag the "I arrived at the porch" piece from the "Events" tab and attach it next to if. Then, click on the "States" tab and drag "there is coffee in the room" and attach it next to <b>and</b>. This block would help the robot check if there is a coffee in the playroom as soon as it arrives in the room. This check is necessary, since we want the robot to take the coffee to the kitchen before taking the mail. Once the robot arrives at the porch and there is coffee in the room, the robot will now need to pick up the coffee. For that, drag the "pick up the toy" piece from actions and attach it next to <b>then</b>.

To do this, click on the "Controls" tab and drag the "if then" piece and attach it to the "Rules" below the previous blocks. Then the event that was just triggered is associated with dropping the coffee specifically “I put down the coffee”. Drag this block from the events tab and attach it to the new rule. Then attach the “go to porch block” action. <br><br> Click <b>Next</b> to proceed.',

Then, click on the "States" tab and drag "there is <b>no coffee</b> in the room" and attach it next to <b>and</b>. The check “there is <b>no coffee</b> in the room” is important because the first item the robot needs to move is the coffee. The robot should move the mail only when there is no coffee on the porch.
