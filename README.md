Here's a rewritten README for your EUP-Blockly project:

# EUP-Blockly

We present an end-user programming interface we designed
that allows users to author programs that instruct a simu-
lated robot to complete tasks in an everyday environmentâ€”
the home. In this simple home environment, the user can
program a TIAGo mobile manipulator robot to complete tasks
as a household assistant. The home we designed has four
rooms: kitchen, bedroom, playroom, and porch (see Figure 1).
Depending on the tasks, the environment includes a person and
a range of everyday objects (e.g., toys, a cup of coffee, mail).
We designed an end-user programming interface where
users can author programs in four different end-user robot
programming paradigms: Sequential Programming (Seq),
Trigger-Action Programming (TAP), Full MDP Program-
ming (Full-MDP), and Goal-Only MDP Programming (Goal-
MDP).


## Demo

Try the interface: [https://eup-blockly.netlify.app](https://eup-blockly.netlify.app)

You can experiment with different tasks and formats by modifying the URL:
- For specific tasks: `https://eup-blockly.netlify.app/task{number}`
- For the Full MDP format: Add `?format=FULL_MDP` to the end of any URL
- - For the Goal MDP format: Add `?format=GOAL_MDP` to the end of any URL
- For the TAP format: Add `?format=TAP` to the end of any URL
- For the Sequential format: Add `?format=SEQ` to the end of any URL
